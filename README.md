# Deep-Learning-Hacks
This repository consists of deep learning assignments done by me during a master level course. 

Most of the models used here are custom build, so you get to learn the low level architecture of a model. 
Keras was not used for couple of assignments however for CNN, RNN and Dense Net you have to use Keras.
